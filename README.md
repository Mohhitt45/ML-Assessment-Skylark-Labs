Machine Learning Engineer Assessment - Activation Swap Challenge
# Machine Learning Engineer Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Skylark Labs ML Engineer Assessment focusing on activation function replacement and fine-tuning.

## Challenge Summary
- **Task**: Replace ReLU activations with SiLU from 7th occurrence onward
- **Model**: ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (3 classes: cat, dog, airplane)
- **Results**: Achieved X.X% validation accuracy

## Files
- `ML_Assessment_MohitAgrawal.ipynb`: Complete solution with all outputs

## Key Results
 Successfully replaced X ReLU activations with SiLU
- Trained for 10 epochs achieving 87.03% final validation accuracy
- Generated confusion matrix and performance analysis

## Requirements Met
✅ All activation replacements implemented correctly
✅ Complete training pipeline with metrics
✅ Reproducible results with fixed seed
✅ Runtime under 20 minutes on CPU
